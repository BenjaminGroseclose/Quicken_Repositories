# Quicken_Repositories

Notes:
  I did my best to develop out and meet the requirements. Things I wish I had done or would do next would be to create unit tests. Also must note that I used my knowledge from our previous interview and learned from his mistakes. For example, saving a timestamp onStop and checking again onStart if it is passed a minute is an idea that came from that. 
  
  Would greatly appreciate any feedback and suggestions on how to have better developed this out. 
   - Specifically had a hard time trying to use MVP along with a RecyclerView. Also felt like the project was a bit smash together instead of developed in a fluid manner.
